# customPixel

For my custom pixel assignment, I decided to create a project using one of my favourite franchises, Pokemon. For this, I used images of two legendary Pokemon, Dialga and Palkia, and created pixel versions of them. They are colour coordinated to their original images, with more neon colours used so that they stand out against the black backdrop. I chose these two Pokemon because I am very fond of the game that they are from, as well as the fact that I thought that their designs looked really cool when pixilated.
